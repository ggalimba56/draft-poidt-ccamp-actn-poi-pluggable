It would be good to have some guidelines describing how the terminology used by Openconfig aligns with the terminology used by IETF:\r\n- one option is to write a terminology draft\r\n- another option is to add an appendix to the DWDM interface model draft\r\n\r\nThe analysis provided in this draft is more generic than POI and applies to any scenario where the DCO and the OLS are under different controllers (PNCs): the draft analysis will stay focused on POI, to keep consistency/alignment with other POI work, but some text will be added to the draft describing the generality of the approach\r\n\r\nTIP MANTRA describe two options to manage these scenarios. The draft is analyzing only one option, the one in which hierarchical controller only is managing e2e service. It might be worthwhile considering both options (second option?) in the next updates to the draft\r\n\r\n- [ ] @ggalimba56 to prepare a list of open issues to share during the IETF 116 presentation\r\n",
